GETLCID(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		    GETLCID(2)

NAME
     getlcid -- get login context

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/lctx.h>

     pid_t
     getlcid(pid_t pid);

DESCRIPTION
     The login context of the process identified by pid is returned by
     getlcid().  If pid is zero, getlcid() returns the login context of the
     current process.

     Login contexts are used for tracking processes that originated from a
     users login session.  A login context is inherited via fork() or by
     explicit creation using the setlcid() call.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, getlcid() returns a non-negative integer, the Login Con-
     text ID; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global variable errno
     is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The getlcid() function will fail if:

     [EPERM]		Operation not permitted.

     [ESRCH]		No such process.

     [ENOATTR]		Attribute not found.
