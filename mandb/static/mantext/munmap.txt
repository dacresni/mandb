MUNMAP(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		     MUNMAP(2)

NAME
     munmap -- remove a mapping

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/mman.h>

     int
     munmap(void *addr, size_t len);

DESCRIPTION
     The munmap() system call deletes the mappings for the specified address
     range, causing further references to addresses within the range to gener-
     ate invalid memory references.

DIRTY PAGE HANDLING
     How munmap() handles a dirty page, depends on what type of memory is
     being unmapped:

     [Anonymous]	If the memory is anonymous memory and if the last ref-
			erence is going away, then the contents are discarded
			by definition of anonymous memory.

     [System V Shared]	If the memory mapping was created using System V
			shared memory, then the contents persist until the
			System V memory region is destroyed or the system is
			rebooted.

     [File mapping]	If the mapping maps data from a file (MAP_SHARED),
			then the memory will eventually be written back to
			disk if it's dirty.  This will happen automatically at
			some point in the future (implementation dependent).
			Note: to force the memory to be written back to the
			disk, use msync(2).

     If there are still other references to the memory when the munmap is
     done, then nothing is done to the memory itself and it may be swapped out
     if need be. The memory will continue to persist until the last reference
     goes away (except for System V shared memory in which case, see above).

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, munmap returns zero.  Otherwise, a value of
     -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     Munmap() will fail if:

     [EINVAL]		The addr parameter was not page aligned (i.e., a mul-
			tiple of the page size).

     [EINVAL]		The len parameter was negative or zero.

     [EINVAL]		Some part of the region being unmapped is not part of
			the currently valid address space.

LEGACY SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/mman.h>

     The include file <sys/types.h> is necessary.

     int
     munmap(caddr_t addr, size_t len);

     The type of addr has changed.

     The munmap() function first appeared in 4.4BSD.
