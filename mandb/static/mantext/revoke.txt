REVOKE(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		     REVOKE(2)

NAME
     revoke -- revoke file access

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     int
     revoke(const char *path);

DESCRIPTION
     The revoke function invalidates all current open file descriptors in the
     system for the file named by path.  Subsequent operations on any such
     descriptors fail, with the exceptions that a read() from a character
     device file which has been revoked returns a count of zero (end of file),
     and a close() call will succeed.  If the file is a special file for a
     device which is open, the device close function is called as if all open
     references to the file had been closed.

     Access to a file may be revoked only by its owner or the super user.  The
     revoke function is currently supported only for block and character spe-
     cial device files.  It is normally used to prepare a terminal device for
     a new login session, preventing any access by a previous user of the ter-
     minal.

RETURN VALUES
     A 0 value indicated that the call succeeded.  A -1 return value indicates
     an error occurred and errno is set to indicated the reason.

ERRORS
     Access to the named file is revoked unless one of the following:

     [ENOTDIR]		A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]	A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or
			an entire path name exceeded 1024 characters.

     [ENOENT]		The named file or a component of the path name does
			not exist.

     [EACCES]		Search permission is denied for a component of the
			path prefix.

     [ELOOP]		Too many symbolic links were encountered in translat-
			ing the pathname.

     [EFAULT]		Path points outside the process's allocated address
			space.

     [EINVAL]		The named file is neither a character special or block
			special file.

     [EPERM]		The caller is neither the owner of the file nor the
			super user.

     [ENOTSUP]		The path does not represent a block or character
			device.

     [EBUSY]		The path represents a block device which is providing
			the backing for a mounted volume.
