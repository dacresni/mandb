LISTEN(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		     LISTEN(2)

NAME
     listen -- listen for connections on a socket

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/socket.h>

     int
     listen(int socket, int backlog);

DESCRIPTION
     Creation of socket-based connections requires several operations.	First,
     a socket is created with socket(2).  Next, a willingness to accept incom-
     ing connections and a queue limit for incoming connections are specified
     with listen().  Finally, the connections are accepted with accept(2).
     The listen() call applies only to sockets of type SOCK_STREAM or
     SOCK_SEQPACKET.

     The backlog parameter defines the maximum length for the queue of pending
     connections.  If a connection request arrives with the queue full, the
     client may receive an error with an indication of ECONNREFUSED.  Alterna-
     tively, if the underlying protocol supports retransmission, the request
     may be ignored so that retries may succeed.

RETURN VALUES
     The listen() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the
     value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the
     error.

ERRORS
     Listen() will fail if:

     [EACCES]		The current process has insufficient privileges.

     [EBADF]		The argument socket is not a valid file descriptor.

     [EDESTADDRREQ]	The socket is not bound to a local address and the
			protocol does not support listening on an unbound
			socket.

     [EINVAL]		socket is already connected.

     [ENOTSOCK] 	The argument socket does not reference a socket.

     [EOPNOTSUPP]	The socket is not of a type that supports the opera-
			tion listen().

SEE ALSO
     accept(2), connect(2), socket(2)

BUGS
     The backlog is currently limited (silently) to 128.

HISTORY
     The listen() function call appeared in 4.2BSD.
