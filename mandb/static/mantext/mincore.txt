MINCORE(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		    MINCORE(2)

NAME
     mincore -- determine residency of memory pages

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/mman.h>

     int
     mincore(caddr_t addr, size_t len, char *vec);

DESCRIPTION
     The mincore() system call allows a process to obtain information about
     whether pages are core resident.  The current core residency of the pages
     is returned in the character array vec.  For each entry in the character
     array vec, the following bit values may be set depending upon the state
     of the page:

	   MINCORE_INCORE	    0x1     /* Page is incore */
	   MINCORE_REFERENCED	    0x2     /* Page has been referenced by us */
	   MINCORE_MODIFIED	    0x4     /* Page has been modified by us */
	   MINCORE_REFERENCED_OTHER 0x8     /* Page has been referenced */
	   MINCORE_MODIFIED_OTHER  0x10     /* Page has been modified */

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     [EINVAL]		addr is not a valid address for user mode.

     [EFAULT]		an error occurred trying to copy to the output charac-
			ter array vec.
