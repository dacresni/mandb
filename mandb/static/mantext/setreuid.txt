SETREUID(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		   SETREUID(2)

NAME
     setreuid -- set real and effective user IDs

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     int
     setreuid(uid_t ruid, uid_t euid);

DESCRIPTION
     The real and effective user IDs of the current process are set according
     to the arguments.	If ruid or euid is -1, the current uid is filled in by
     the system.  Unprivileged users may change the real user ID to the effec-
     tive user ID and vice-versa; only the super-user may make other changes.

     The setreuid() function has been used to swap the real and effective user
     IDs in set-user-ID programs to temporarily relinquish the set-user-ID
     value.  This purpose is now better served by the use of the seteuid()
     function (see setuid(2)).

     When setting the real and effective user IDs to the same value, the stan-
     dard setuid() function is preferred.

RETURN VALUES
     The setreuid() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the
     value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the
     error.

ERRORS
     [EPERM]		The current process is not the super-user and a change
			other than changing the effective user-id to the real
			user-id was specified.
