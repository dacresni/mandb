LISTXATTR(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		  LISTXATTR(2)

NAME
     listxattr, flistxattr -- list extended attribute names

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/xattr.h>

     ssize_t
     listxattr(const char *path, char *namebuf, size_t size, int options);

     ssize_t
     flistxattr(int fd, char *namebuf, size_t size, int options);

DESCRIPTION
     Extended attributes extend the basic attributes associated with files and
     directories in the file system.  They are stored as name:data pairs asso-
     ciated with file system objects (files, directories, symlinks, etc).

     listxattr() retrieves a list of names of extended attributes associated
     with the given path in the file system.

     namebuf is a data buffer of size bytes for the names of the extended
     attributes associated with path.  The extended attribute names are simple
     NULL-terminated UTF-8 strings and are returned in arbitrary order.  No
     extra padding is provided between names in the buffer.  The list will
     only include names of extended attributes to which the calling process
     has access.  The function returns the size of the list of names.

     options controls how the attribute list is generated:

     XATTR_NOFOLLOW  do not follow symbolic links.  listxattr() normally lists
		     attributes of the target of path if it is a symbolic
		     link.  With this option, listxattr() will list attributes
		     of the link itself.

     XATTR_SHOWCOMPRESSION
		     listxattr() and flistxattr() will list HFS Plus Compres-
		     sion extended attribute(s) (if present) for the file
		     referred to by path or fd.

     If namebuf is set to NULL, the function returns the size of the list of
     extended attribute names.	This facility can be used to determine the
     size of a buffer sufficiently large to hold the names of the attributes
     currently associated with path.

     flistxattr() is identical to listxattr(), except that it returns the list
     of extended attribute names associated with the open file referenced by
     file descriptor fd.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, the size of the extended attribute name list is returned.  If
     no accessible extended attributes are associated with the given path or
     fd, the function returns zero.  On failure, -1 is returned and the global
     variable errno is set as follows.

ERRORS
     [ENOTSUP]		The file system does not support extended attributes
			or has the feature disabled.

     [ERANGE]		namebuf (as indicated by size) is too small to hold
			the list of names.

     [EPERM]		path or fd refer to a file system object that does not
			support extended attributes.  For example, resource
			forks don't support extended attributes.

     [ENOTDIR]		A component of path 's prefix is not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]	name exceeds XATTR_MAXNAMELEN UTF-8 bytes, or a compo-
			nent of path exceeds NAME_MAX characters, or the
			entire path exceeds PATH_MAX characters.

     [EACCES]		Search permission is denied for a component of path or
			permission is denied to read the list of attributes
			from this file.

     [ELOOP]		Too many symbolic links were encountered resolving
			path.

     [EFAULT]		path points to an invalid address.

     [EIO]		An I/O error occurred.

     [EINVAL]		options does not make sense.
