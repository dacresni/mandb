NAME
     removexattr, fremovexattr -- remove an extended attribute value

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/xattr.h>

     int
     removexattr(const char *path, const char *name, int options);

     int
     fremovexattr(int fd, const char *name, int options);

DESCRIPTION
     Extended attributes extend the basic attributes associated with files and
     directories in the file system.  They are stored as name:data pairs asso-
     ciated with file system objects (files, directories, symlinks, etc).

     Removexattr() deletes the extended attribute name associated with path.

     An extended attribute's name is a simple NULL-terminated UTF-8 string.
     Options is a bit mask specifying various options:

     XATTR_NOFOLLOW  do not follow symbolic links.  Normally, removexattr()
		     acts on the target of path if it is a symbolic link.
		     With this option, removexattr() will act on the link
		     itself.

     XATTR_SHOWCOMPRESSION
		     removexattr() and fremovexattr() will remove HFS Plus
		     Compression extended attribute name (if present) for the
		     file referred to by path or fd.

     fremovexattr() is identical to removexattr(), except that it removes an
     extended attribute from an open file referenced by file descriptor fd.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, 0 is returned.  On failure, -1 is returned and the global
     variable errno is set as follows.
