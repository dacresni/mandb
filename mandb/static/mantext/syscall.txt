SYSCALL(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		    SYSCALL(2)

NAME
     syscall -- indirect system call

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/syscall.h>
     #include <unistd.h>

     int
     syscall(int number, ...);

DESCRIPTION
     Syscall() performs the system call whose assembly language interface has
     the specified number with the specified arguments.  Symbolic constants
     for system calls can be found in the header file <sys/syscall.h>.	This
     function is useful for testing new system calls that do not have entries
     in the C library.

RETURN VALUES
     The return values are defined by the system call being invoked.  In gen-
     eral, a 0 return value indicates success.	A -1 return value indicates an
     error, and an error code is stored in errno.

BUGS
     There is no way to simulate system calls that have multiple return values
     such as pipe(2).

HISTORY
     The syscall() function call appeared in 4.0BSD.
