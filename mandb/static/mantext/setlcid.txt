SETLCID(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		    SETLCID(3)

NAME
     setlcid -- set login context

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/lctx.h>

     int
     setlcid(pid_t pid, pid_t lcid);

DESCRIPTION
     The setlcid() system call sets the login context of the specified process
     pid to the specified lcid.  If the pid is zero, then the call applies to
     the current process.  If the lcid is zero a new login context will be
     created.  If the lcid is -1 the process will be removed from the login
     context it is currently a member of, if any.

     Creation of a new login context is only valid for the current process.  A
     process may not create a new login context if it is currently a member of
     one.

     Superuser privilege is required to add or remove a process from a login
     context.

RETURN VALUES
     The setlcid() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the
     value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the
     error.

ERRORS
     The setlcid() function will fail if:

     [EPERM]		Operation not permitted.

     [ESRCH]		No such process.

     [ENOMEM]		Cannot allocate memory.

     [ENOATTR]		Attribute not found.
