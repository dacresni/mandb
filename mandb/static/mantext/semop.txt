SEMOP(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		      SEMOP(2)

NAME
     semop -- atomic array of operations on a semaphore set

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/sem.h>

     int
     semop(int semid, struct sembuf *sops, size_t nsops);

DESCRIPTION
     The semop() system call atomically performs the array of operations indi-
     cated by sops on the semaphore set indicated by semid.  The length of
     sops is indicated by nsops.  Each operation is encoded in a struct
     sembuf, which is defined as follows:

     struct sembuf {
	     u_short sem_num;	     /* semaphore # */
	     short   sem_op;	     /* semaphore operation */
	     short   sem_flg;	     /* operation flags */
     };

     For each element in sops, sem_op and sem_flg determine an operation to be
     performed on semaphore number sem_num in the set.	The values SEM_UNDO
     and IPC_NOWAIT may be OR'ed into the sem_flg member in order to modify
     the behavior of the given operation.

     The operation performed depends as follows on the value of sem_op:

     o	 When sem_op is positive and the process has alter permission, the
	 semaphore's value is incremented by sem_op's value.  If SEM_UNDO is
	 specified, the semaphore's adjust on exit value is decremented by
	 sem_op's value.  A positive value for sem_op generally corresponds to
	 a process releasing a resource associated with the semaphore.

     o	 The behavior when sem_op is negative and the process has alter per-
	 mission, depends on the current value of the semaphore:

	 o   If the current value of the semaphore is greater than or equal to
	     the absolute value of sem_op, then the value is decremented by
	     the absolute value of sem_op.  If SEM_UNDO is specified, the sem-
	     aphore's adjust on exit value is incremented by the absolute
	     value of sem_op.

	 o   If the current value of the semaphore is less than the absolute
	     value of sem_op, one of the following happens:

	     o	 If IPC_NOWAIT was specified, then semop() returns immediately
		 with a return value of EAGAIN.

	     o	 Otherwise, the calling process is put to sleep until one of
		 the following conditions is satisfied:

		 o   Some other process removes the semaphore with the
		     IPC_RMID option of semctl(2).  In this case, semop()
		     returns immediately with a return value of EIDRM.

		 o   The process receives a signal that is to be caught.  In
		     this case, the process will resume execution as defined
		     by sigaction(2).

		 o   The semaphore's value is greater than or equal to the
		     absolute value of sem_op.	When this condition becomes
		     true, the semaphore's value is decremented by the abso-
		     lute value of sem_op, the semaphore's adjust on exit
		     value is incremented by the absolute value of sem_op.

	 A negative value for sem_op generally means that a process is waiting
	 for a resource to become available.

     o	 When sem_op is zero and the process has read permission, one of the
	 following will occur:

	 o   If the current value of the semaphore is equal to zero then
	     semop() can return immediately.

	 o   If IPC_NOWAIT was specified, then semop() returns immediately
	     with a return value of EAGAIN.

	 o   Otherwise, the calling process is put to sleep until one of the
	     following conditions is satisfied:

	     o	 Some other process removes the semaphore with the IPC_RMID
		 option of semctl(2).  In this case, semop() returns immedi-
		 ately with a return value of EIDRM.

	     o	 The process receives a signal that is to be caught.  In this
		 case, the process will resume execution as defined by
		 sigaction(2).

	     o	 The semaphore's value becomes zero.

     For each semaphore a process has in use, the kernel maintains an ``adjust
     on exit'' value, as alluded to earlier.  When a process exits, either
     voluntarily or involuntarily, the adjust on exit value for each semaphore
     is added to the semaphore's value.  This can be used to insure that a
     resource is released if a process terminates unexpectedly.

RETURN VALUES
     The semop() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the
     value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the
     error.

ERRORS
     The semop() system call will fail if:

     [E2BIG]		Too many operations are specified.  [SEMOPM]

     [EACCES]		Permission is denied, due to a mismatch between the
			operation and the mode of the semaphore set.

     [EAGAIN]		The semaphore's value would result in the process
			being put to sleep and IPC_NOWAIT is specified.

     [EFBIG]		sem_num is not in the range of valid semaphores for
			the set.

     [EIDRM]		The semaphore set is removed from the system.

     [EINTR]		The semop() system call is interrupted by a signal.

     [EINVAL]		No semaphore set corresponds to semid, or the process
			would exceed the system-defined limit for the number
			of per-process SEM_UNDO structures.

     [ENOSPC]		The system SEM_UNDO pool [SEMMNU] is full.

     [ERANGE]		The requested operation would cause either the sema-
			phore's current value [SEMVMX] or its adjust-on-exit
			value [SEMAEM] to exceed the system-imposed limits.

BUGS
     The semop() system call may block waiting for memory even if IPC_NOWAIT
     was specified.
