AUDITCTL(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		   AUDITCTL(2)

NAME
     auditctl -- configure system audit parameters

SYNOPSIS
     #include <bsm/audit.h>

     int
     auditctl(const char *path);

DESCRIPTION
     The auditctl() system call directs the kernel to open a new audit trail
     log file.	It requires an appropriate privilege.  The auditctl() system
     call opens new files, but auditon(2) is used to disable the audit log.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, the value 0 is returned; otherwise the
     value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the
     error.

ERRORS
     The auditctl() system call will fail if:

     [EINVAL]		The path is invalid.

     [EPERM]		The process does not have sufficient permission to
			complete the operation.
