SHM_OPEN(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		   SHM_OPEN(2)

NAME
     shm_open -- open a shared memory object

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/mman.h>

     int
     shm_open(const char *name, int oflag, ...);

     The parameter "mode_t mode" is optional.

DESCRIPTION
     The shared memory object referenced by name is opened for reading and/or
     writing as specified by the argument oflag and the file descriptor
     returned to the calling process.  The returned file descriptor will be
     the lowest non-open file descriptor for the calling process, and is not
     shared with any other processes, as it is a new file descriptor. The new
     file descriptor will have the FD_CLOEXEC flag set.  Repeated calls to
     shm_open with the same string value for name() will return a file
     descriptor referring to the same shared memory object, provided that the
     object has not been unlinked by a call to shm_unlink().  The oflag argu-
     ment may indicate the file is to be created if it does not exist (by
     specifying the O_CREAT flag), in which case the file is created with mode
     mode as described in chmod(2) and modified by the process' umask value
     (see umask(2)).

     The value of oflag is formed by or'ing the following values:

	   O_RDONLY	   open for reading only
	   O_RDWR	   open for reading and writing
	   O_CREAT	   create object if it does not exist
	   O_EXCL	   error if create and object exists
	   O_TRUNC	   truncate size to 0

     Exactly one of O_RDONLY or O_RDWR must be specified.

     If O_TRUNC is specified and the file exists, the file is truncated to
     zero length.  If O_EXCL is set with O_CREAT and the file already exists,
     shm_open() returns an error.  This may be used to implement a simple
     exclusive access locking mechanism.

     If successful, shm_open() returns a non-negative integer, termed a file
     descriptor.  It returns -1 and sets errno on failure.  The file pointer
     used to mark the current position within the memory object is set to the
     beginning of the object.

     When a new shared memory object is created it is given the owner and
     group corresponding to the effective user and group of the calling
     process. There is no visible entry in the file system for the created
     object in this implementation.

     When a shared memory object is created, it persists until it it unlinked
     and all other references are gone. Objects do not persist across a system
     reboot.

     The system imposes a limit on the number of file descriptors open simul-
     taneously by one process.	Getdtablesize(2) returns the current system
     limit.

ERRORS
     The named object is opened unless:

     [EACCES]		The required permissions (for reading and/or writing)
			are denied for the given flags.

     [EACCES]		O_CREAT is specified, the object does not exist, and
			permission to create the object is denied.

     [EEXIST]		O_CREAT and O_EXCL were specified and the object
			exists.

     [EINTR]		The shm_open() operation was interrupted by a signal.

     [EINVAL]		The shm_open() operation is not supported.

     [EMFILE]		The process has already reached its limit for open
			file descriptors.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]	name exceeded the name size limit.  This is currently
			PSHMNAMLEN characters (defined in <sys/posix_shm.h>),
			but this may change in the future.

     [ENFILE]		The system file table is full.

     [ENOENT]		O_CREAT is not set and the named object does not
			exist.

     [ENOSPC]		O_CREAT is specified, the file does not exist, and
			there is insufficient space available to create the
			object.

HISTORY
     shm_open() is specified in the POSIX Realtime Extension
     (1003.1b-1993/1003.1i-1995).
