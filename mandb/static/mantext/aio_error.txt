AIO_ERROR(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		  AIO_ERROR(2)

NAME
     aio_error -- retrieve error status of asynchronous I/O operation (REAL-
     TIME)

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <aio.h>

     int
     aio_error(const struct aiocb *aiocbp);

DESCRIPTION
     The aio_error() system call returns the error status of the asynchronous
     I/O request associated with the structure pointed to by aiocbp.

RETURN VALUES
     If the asynchronous I/O request has completed successfully, aio_error()
     returns 0.  If the request has not yet completed, EINPROGRESS is
     returned.	If the request has completed unsuccessfully, the error status
     is returned as described in read(2), write(2), or fsync(2) is returned.
     On failure, aio_error() returns -1 and sets errno to indicate the error
     condition.

ERRORS
     The aio_error() system call will fail if:

     [EINVAL]		The aiocbp argument does not reference an outstanding
			asynchronous I/O request.

     (``POSIX.1'') standard.
