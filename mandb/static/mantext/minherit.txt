MINHERIT(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		   MINHERIT(2)

NAME
     minherit -- control the inheritance of pages

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/mman.h>

     int
     minherit(caddr_t addr, size_t len, int inherit);

DESCRIPTION
     The minherit() system call changes the specified pages to have the inher-
     itance characteristic inherit, which can be set to VM_INHERIT_NONE,
     VM_INHERIT_COPY, or VM_INHERIT_SHARE.  Not all implementations will guar-
     antee that the inheritance characteristic can be set on a page basis; the
     granularity of changes may be as large as an entire region.

RETURN VALUES
     The minherit() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the
     value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the
     error.

ERRORS
     The minherit() system call will fail if:

     [EINVAL]		The virtual address range specified by the addr and
			len arguments is not valid.

     [EACCES]		The flags specified by the inherit argument were not
			valid for the pages specified by the addr and len
			arguments.
