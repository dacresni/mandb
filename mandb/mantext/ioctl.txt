IOCTL(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		      IOCTL(2)

NAME
     ioctl -- control device

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/ioctl.h>

     int
     ioctl(int fildes, unsigned long request, ...);

DESCRIPTION
     The ioctl() function manipulates the underlying device parameters of spe-
     cial files.  In particular, many operating characteristics of character
     special files (e.g. terminals) may be controlled with ioctl() requests.
     The argument fildes must be an open file descriptor.

     An  ioctl request has encoded in it whether the argument is an ``in''
     parameter or ``out'' parameter, and the size of the argument argp in
     bytes.  Macros and defines used in specifying an ioctl request are
     located in the file <sys/ioctl.h>.

RETURN VALUES
     If an error has occurred, a value of -1 is returned and errno is set to
     indicate the error.

ERRORS
     Ioctl() will fail if:

     [EBADF]		fildes is not a valid descriptor.

     [EINVAL]		Request or argp is not valid.

     [ENOTTY]		fildes is not associated with a character special
			device.

     [ENOTTY]		The specified request does not apply to the kind of
			object that the descriptor fildes references.

HISTORY
