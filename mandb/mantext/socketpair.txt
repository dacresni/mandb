SOCKETPAIR(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		 SOCKETPAIR(2)

NAME
     socketpair -- create a pair of connected sockets

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/socket.h>

     int
     socketpair(int domain, int type, int protocol, int socket_vector[2]);

DESCRIPTION
     The socketpair() call creates an unnamed pair of connected sockets in the
     specified domain domain, of the specified type, and using the optionally
     specified protocol.  The descriptors used in referencing the new sockets
     are returned in socket_vector[0] and socket_vector[1].  The two sockets
     are indistinguishable.

RETURN VALUES
     The socketpair() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise
     the value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate
     the error.

ERRORS
     The call succeeds unless:

     [EAFNOSUPPORT]	The specified address family is not supported on this
			machine.

     [EFAULT]		The address socket_vector does not specify a valid
			part of the process address space.

     [EMFILE]		No more file descriptors are available for this
			process.

     [ENFILE]		No more file descriptors are available for the system.

     [ENOBUFS]		Insufficient resources were available in the system to
			perform the operation.

     [ENOMEM]		Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the
			request.

     [EOPNOTSUPP]	The specified protocol does not support creation of
			socket pairs.

     [EPROTONOSUPPORT]	The specified protocol is not supported on this
			machine.

     [EPROTOTYPE]	The socket type is not supported by the protocol.

     [EACCES]		The process does not have appropriate privileges to
			create a socket of the specified type and/or protocol.

LEGACY SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/socket.h>

     The include file <sys/types.h> is necessary.
