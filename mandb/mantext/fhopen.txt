FHOPEN(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		     FHOPEN(2)

NAME
     fhopen -- open a file by file handle

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/mount.h>

     int
     fhopen(const struct fhandle *fhp, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
     The file specified by the given file handle is opened for reading and/or
     writing, as specified by the argument flags; the file descriptor is
     returned to the calling process.

     This system call is restricted to the super-user and is used by an NFS
     server's rpc.lockd(8) daemon to open a file in order to perform locking
     operations on it.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is
     returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     fhopen() fails if one or more of the following are true:

     [ESTALE]		The file handle no longer refers to a valid, NFS-
			exported object.

     [EPERM]		The caller is not the super-user.

     [EINVAL]		There was a problem with the value of one of the argu-
			ments.

     [EFAULT]		fhp points to an invalid address.
