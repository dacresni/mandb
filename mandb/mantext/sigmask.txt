SIGSETMASK(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		 SIGSETMASK(2)

NAME
     sigsetmask -- set current signal mask

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <signal.h>

     int
     sigsetmask(int mask);

     sigmask(signum);

DESCRIPTION
     This interface is made obsolete by: sigprocmask(2).

     Sigsetmask() sets the current signal mask.  Signals are blocked from
     delivery if the corresponding bit in mask is a 1; the macro sigmask() is
     provided to construct the mask for a given signum.

     The system quietly disallows SIGKILL or SIGSTOP to be blocked.

RETURN VALUES
     The previous set of masked signals is returned.

HISTORY
     The sigsetmask() function call appeared in 4.2BSD and has been depre-
     cated.
