SETAUID(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		    SETAUID(2)

NAME
     setauid -- set audit indentifier

SYNOPSIS
     #include <bsm/audit.h>

     int
     setauid(au_id_t *auid);

DESCRIPTION
     The setauid() system call sets the active audit identifier for the cur-
     rent process from the au_id_t pointed to by auid.	The value of AU_DEFAU-
     DITID (-1) should not be used for auid.

     This system call requires an appropriate privilege to complete.

     Once the audit identifier is set to some other value than AU_DEAUDITID
     (-1) then it is immutable.  This system call may be used to set the audit
     identifier after initially setting up the audit session with the
     setaudit(2), or setaudit_addr(2) system call.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, the value 0 is returned; otherwise the
     value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the
     error.

ERRORS
     The setauid() function will fail if:

     [EFAULT]		A failure occurred while data transferred to the ker-
			nel failed.

     [EINVAL]		An invalid value for auid was used.  auid can be any
			value of type au_id_t except AU_DEFAUDITID.

     [EPERM]		The process does not have sufficient permission to
			complete the operation.

     It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation
     for the OpenBSM distribution.
