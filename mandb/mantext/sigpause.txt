SIGPAUSE(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		   SIGPAUSE(2)

NAME
     sigpause -- atomically release blocked signals and wait for interrupt

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <signal.h>

     int
     sigpause(int sig);

DESCRIPTION
     This interface is made obsolete by sigsuspend(2).

     Sigpause() assigns sig to the set of masked signals and then waits for a
     signal to arrive; on return the set of masked signals is restored.  Sig
     is usually 0, indicating that no signals are to be blocked.  Sigpause()
     always terminates by being interrupted, returning -1 with errno set to
     EINTR.

COMPATIBILITY
     sigpause() now takes a signal value and not a mask.  This often appears
     as a hang in sigpause$UNIX2003 or with sigpause() returning with errno
     set to EINVAL.  Use sigsuspend() with signal masks.

SEE ALSO
     kill(2), sigaction(2), sigblock(2), sigprocmask(2), sigsuspend(2),
     sigvec(2)

HISTORY
     The sigpause() function call appeared in 4.2BSD and has been deprecated.
