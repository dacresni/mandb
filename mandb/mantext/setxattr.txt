SETXATTR(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		   SETXATTR(2)

NAME
     setxattr, fsetxattr -- set an extended attribute value

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/xattr.h>

     int
     setxattr(const char *path, const char *name, void *value, size_t size,
	 u_int32_t position, int options);

     int
     fsetxattr(int fd, const char *name, void *value, size_t size,
	 u_int32_t position, int options);

DESCRIPTION
     Extended attributes extend the basic attributes associated with files and
     directories in the file system.  They are stored as name:data pairs asso-
     ciated with file system objects (files, directories, symlinks, etc).

     setxattr() associates name and data together as an attribute of path.

     An extended attribute's name is a simple NULL-terminated UTF-8 string.
     Value is a pointer to a data buffer of size bytes containing textual or
     binary data to be associated with the extended attribute.	Position spec-
     ifies the offset within the extended attribute.  In the current implemen-
     tation, only the resource fork extended attribute makes use of this argu-
     ment.  For all others, position is reserved and should be set to zero.

     options controls how the attribute is set:

     XATTR_NOFOLLOW  do not follow symbolic links.  setxattr() normally sets
		     attributes on the target of path if it is a symbolic
		     link.  With this option, setxattr() will act on the link
		     itself.

     XATTR_CREATE    fail if the named attribute already exists.

     XATTR_REPLACE   fail if the named attribute does not exist.  Failure to
		     specify XATTR_REPLACE or XATTR_CREATE allows creation and
		     replacement.

     fsetxattr() is identical to setxattr(), except that it sets an extended
     attribute on an open file referenced by file descriptor fd.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, 0 is returned.  On failure, -1 is returned and the global
     variable errno is set as follows.

ERRORS
     [EEXIST]		options contains XATTR_CREATE and the named attribute
			already exists.

     [ENOATTR]		options is set to XATTR_REPLACE and the named
			attribute does not exist.

     [ENOTSUP]		The file system does not support extended attributes
			or has them disabled.

     [EROFS]		The file system is mounted read-only.

     [ERANGE]		The data size of the attribute is out of range (some
			attributes have size restrictions).

     [EPERM]		Attributes cannot be associated with this type of
			object.  For example, attributes are not allowed for
			resource forks.

     [EINVAL]		name or options is invalid.  name must be valid UTF-8
			and options must make sense.

     [ENOTDIR]		A component of path is not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]	name exceeded XATTR_MAXNAMELEN UTF-8 bytes, or a com-
			ponent of path exceeded NAME_MAX characters, or the
			entire path exceeded PATH_MAX characters.

     [EACCES]		Search permission is denied for a component of path or
			permission to set the attribute is denied.

     [ELOOP]		Too many symbolic links were encountered resolving
			path.

     [EFAULT]		path or name points to an invalid address.

     [EIO]		An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to
			the file system.

     [E2BIG]		The data size of the extended attribute is too large.

     [ENOSPC]		Not enough space left on the file system.
