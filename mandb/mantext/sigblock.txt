SIGBLOCK(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		   SIGBLOCK(2)

NAME
     sigblock -- block signals

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <signal.h>

     int
     sigblock(int mask);

     int
     sigmask(signum);

DESCRIPTION
     This interface is made obsolete by sigprocmask(2).

     Sigblock() adds the signals specified in mask to the set of signals cur-
     rently being blocked from delivery.  Signals are blocked if the corre-
     sponding bit in mask is a 1; the macro sigmask() is provided to construct
     the mask for a given signum.

     It is not possible to block SIGKILL or SIGSTOP; this restriction is
     silently imposed by the system.

RETURN VALUES
     The previous set of masked signals is returned.

HISTORY
     The sigblock() function call appeared in 4.2BSD and has been deprecated.
