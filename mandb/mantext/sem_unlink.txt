SEM_UNLINK(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		 SEM_UNLINK(2)

NAME
     sem_unlink -- remove a named semaphore

SYNOPSIS
     #include <semaphore.h>

     int
     sem_unlink(const char *name);

DESCRIPTION
     The named semaphore named name is removed.  If the semaphore is in use by
     other processes, then name is immediately disassociated with the sema-
     phore, but the semaphore itself will not be removed until all references
     to it have been closed.  Subsequent calls to sem_open() using name will
     refer to or create a new semaphore named name.

     If successful, sem_unlink() will return 0.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and
     errno is set, and the state of the semaphore is unchanged.

ERRORS
     sem_unlink() succeeds unless:

     [EACCES]		Permission is denied to be remove the semaphore.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]	name exceeded SEM_NAME_LEN characters.

     [ENOENT]		The named semaphore does not exist.

HISTORY
     sem_unlink() is specified in the POSIX Realtime Extension
     (1003.1b-1993/1003.1i-1995).
