NAME
     searchfs -- search a volume quickly

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/attr.h>
     #include <unistd.h>

     int
     searchfs(const char* path, struct fssearchblock* searchBlock,
	 unsigned int* numMatches, unsigned int scriptCode,
	 unsigned int options, struct searchstate* state);

DESCRIPTION
     The searchfs() function searches the volume (that is, mounted file sys-
     tem) specified by path for file system objects matching the criteria
     specified by searchBlock, scriptCode, and options.  The numMatches param-
     eter returns the number of matching file system objects found.  The func-
     tion also returns attributes of those file system objects in a buffer
     specified by searchBlock.	The searchState parameter allows you search
     the volume using multiple calls to searchfs(), resuming the search where
     it left off.  The routine will only return objects to which you have
     access (that is, you have execute permissions on the directories leading
     to this object from the root).

     The path parameter must reference a valid file system object on the vol-
     ume to be searched.  Typically the path is to the volume's root direc-
     tory.  The entire volume is always searched.  All directories listed in
     the path name leading to this object must be searchable.

     The searchBlock parameter is a pointer to an fssearchblock structure, as
     defined by <sys/attr.h> (shown below).  You are responsible for filling
     out all fields of this structure before calling the function.

     struct fssearchblock {
	 struct attrlist *   returnattrs;
	 void * 	     returnbuffer;
	 size_t 	     returnbuffersize;
	 unsigned int	     maxmatches;
	 struct timeval      timelimit;
	 void * 	     searchparams1;
	 size_t 	     sizeofsearchparams1;
	 void * 	     searchparams2;
	 size_t 	     sizeofsearchparams2;
	 struct attrlist     searchattrs;
     };

     For information about the attrlist structure, see the discussion of
     getattrlist(2).

     The fields of the fssearchblock structure are defined as follows.

     returnattrs	  searchfs() can return arbitrary attributes of the
			  file system objects that meet the designated search
			  criteria passed in via searchparams1 and
			  searchparams2. This field must point to an attrlist
			  structure that specifies the attributes that you
			  want returned.  To request an attribute you must set
			  the corresponding bit in the appropriate attrgroup_t
			  field of the attrlist structure.  You are responsi-
			  ble for filling out all fields of this structure
			  before calling the function.	You must not request
			  volume attributes.

     returnbuffer	  searchfs() places attributes of the matching file
			  system objects into this returned attributes buffer.
			  The attributes for any given object are grouped
			  together and packed in exactly the same way as they
			  would be returned from getdirentriesattr(2).	The
			  initial contents of this buffer are ignored.

     returnbuffersize	  Set this field to the size, in bytes, of the buffer
			  pointed to by returnbuffer.

     maxmatches 	  Specifies the maximum number of matches that you
			  want this call to searchfs() to return.

     timelimit		  Specifies the maximum time that you want this call
			  to searchfs() to run.

			  If you're implementing a volume format, you should
			  impose your own internal limit on the duration of
			  this call to prevent a malicious user program from
			  monopolizing kernel resources.

     searchparams1	  Specifies the lower bound of the search criteria.
			  This is discussed in detail below.  You must place
			  attribute values into the buffer in the same way as
			  they would be returned by getattrlist(2), where the
			  searchattrs field determines the exact layout of the
			  attribute values.

     sizeofsearchparams1  Set this field to the size, in bytes, of the buffer
			  pointed to by searchparams1.

     searchparams2	  Specifies the upper bound of the search criteria.
			  This is discussed in detail below.  You must place
			  attribute values into the buffer in the same way as
			  they would be returned by getattrlist(2), where the
			  searchattrs field determines the exact layout of the
			  attribute values.

     sizeofsearchparams2  Set this field to the size, in bytes, of the buffer
			  pointed to by searchparams2.

     searchattrs	  Specifies the attributes that you want you use for
			  your search criteria.  You are responsible for fill-
			  ing out all fields of this structure before calling
			  the function.  To search for an attribute you must
			  set the corresponding bit in the appropriate
			  attrgroup_t field of the attrlist structure, and
			  place the appropriate values into the searchparam1
			  and searchparam2 buffers.  The attributes specified
			  here determine the format of those buffers.  This is
			  discussed in detail below.

     The numMatches parameter points to an unsigned int variable.  The initial
     value of this variable is ignored.  On return, this variable contains the
     number of matching file system objects found.  The is always less than or
     equal to the maxmatches field of the searchBlock parameter.  The
     attributes for the matching objects have been placed into the returned
     attributes buffer.

     The scriptCode parameter is currently ignored.  You should always pass in
     the value 0x08000103, which corresponds to the UTF-8 text encoding value
     defined by <CarbonCore/TextCommon.h>.

     The options parameter is a bit set that controls the behaviour of
     searchfs().  The following option bits are defined.

     SRCHFS_START	       If this bit is set, searchfs() will ignore the
			       state parameter and start a new search.	Other-
			       wise searchfs() assumes that searchstate is
			       valid and attempts to resume a previous search
			       based on that state.

     SRCHFS_MATCHPARTIALNAMES  If this bit is set, searchfs() will consider
			       substrings to be successful matches when evalu-
			       ating the ATTR_CMN_NAME attribute.

     SRCHFS_MATCHDIRS	       If this bit is set, searchfs() will search for
			       directories that match the search criteria.  To
			       get meaningful results you must specify either
			       this bit or SRCHFS_MATCHFILES, or both.

     SRCHFS_MATCHFILES	       If this bit is set, searchfs() will search for
			       files that match the search criteria.  To get
			       meaningful results you must specify either this
			       bit or SRCHFS_MATCHDIRS, or both.

     SRCHFS_SKIPLINKS	       If this bit is set, searchfs() will only return
			       one reference for a hard linked file, rather
			       than a reference for each hard link to the
			       file.

			       This option is not recommended for general
			       development.  Its primary client is the
			       quotacheck(2) utility.  Note that not all
			       filesystems that support searchfs() support
			       this option and may return EINVAL if it is
			       requested.

			       This option is privileged (the caller's effec-
			       tive UID must be 0) and cannot be used if you
			       request the ATTR_CMN_NAME or ATTR_CMN_PAROBJID
			       attributes.

			       Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X version
			       10.3).

     SRCHFS_SKIPINVISIBLE      If this bit is set, searchfs() will not match
			       any invisible file system objects (that is,
			       objects whose ATTR_CMN_FNDRINFO attribute has
			       bit 6 set in the ninth byte) or any objects
			       within invisible directories.

			       Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X version
			       10.3).

     SRCHFS_SKIPPACKAGES       If this bit is set, searchfs() will not match
			       any file system objects that are inside a pack-
			       age.  A package is defined as a directory whose
			       extension matches one of the extensions that
			       are configured into the kernel by Launch Ser-
			       vices.

			       Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X version
			       10.3).

     SRCHFS_SKIPINAPPROPRIATE  If this bit is set, searchfs() will not match
			       any file system objects that are within an
			       inappropriate directory.  The current list of
			       inappropriate directories contains one item:
			       /System.

			       Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X version
			       10.3).

     SRCHFS_NEGATEPARAMS       If this bit is set, searchfs() will return all
			       the file system objects that do not match the
			       search criteria.

			       Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X version
			       10.3).

     The state parameter is a pointer to an opaque data structure that
     searchfs() uses to maintain the state of a search between successive
     calls.  In your first call to searchfs(), you specify the SRCHFS_START
     flag in the options parameter.  This tells searchfs() that the search
     state is invalid and that it should start a new search.  When this call
     completes, it may have only returned partial results; in that case, it
     will have updated the structure pointed to by state.  If you call
     searchfs() again, this time without specifying the SRCHFS_START flag in
     the options parameter, it will resume the search where it left off, using
     the search state that it previously stored in the state structure.  You
     do not need to explicitly dispose of this state.

     The searchfs() function returns significant errors in the followings
     cases.

     o	 If it has found as many objects as you requested in the maxmatches
	 field of the searchBlock parameter, it will return EAGAIN.

     o	 If there is not enough space in the returned attributes buffer for
	 the first match, it will return ENOBUFS.  You should allocate a
	 larger returned attributes buffer and try again.  numMatches will be
	 zero in this case.

     o	 If the timeout expires it will return EAGAIN.

     o	 If you attempt to resume a search (that is, SRCHFS_START is not spec-
	 ified in the options parameter) and the catalog has changed since the
	 last search, the function will return EBUSY.  You must start your
	 search again from the beginning.

     If searchfs() returns EAGAIN, the value in numMatches may be greater than
     zero.  This is known as a partial result.	You should be sure to process
     these matches before calling searchfs() again.

SEARCH CRITERIA
     You specify the search criteria using a combination of the searchattrs,
     searchparams1, sizeofsearchparams1, searchparams2, and
     sizeofsearchparams2 fields of the searchBlock parameter, and various
     flags in the options parameter.  The searchattrs field determines the
     attributes considered when comparing a file system object to the search
     criteria.	You can specify that an attribute should be considered by set-
     ting the corresponding bit in the appropriate attrgroup_t field of the
     attrlist structure.  See the discussion of getattrlist(2) for a detailed
     description of this structure.

     The searchparams1, sizeofsearchparams1, searchparams2, and
     sizeofsearchparams2 fields specify the attribute values that must be
     matched.  The format of each of these buffers is determined by the
     attributes that you're searching for.  The values are packed in exactly
     the same way as they would be returned from getattrlist(2), including the
     leading u_int32_t length value.  Note that the size of these buffers must
     be bounded by SEARCHFS_MAX_SEARCHPARMS bytes, which is defined in
     <sys/attr.h>.

     The attribute values in the first and second search buffers form a lower
     and upper bound for the search, respectively.  These have different mean-
     ings depending on the type of attribute.

     o	 For string attributes (specifically ATTR_CMN_NAME, the object name),
	 the value in the first search buffer is significant and the value in
	 the second search buffer is ignored.  The string comparison is either
	 an exact match or a substring match depending on the
	 SRCHFS_MATCHPARTIALNAMES flag in the options parameter.

     o	 For structured attributes (specifically ATTR_CMN_FNDRINFO, the Finder
	 information), the value from the file system object is masked (logi-
	 cal AND) with the value in the second search buffer and then com-
	 pared, byte for byte, against the value in the first search buffer.
	 If it is equal, the object is a match.

     o	 For scalar attributes (all other attributes, for example,
	 ATTR_CMN_MODTIME, the modification date), the values in the first and
	 second search buffers are literally a lower and upper bound.  An
	 object matches the criteria if its value is greater than or equal to
	 the value in the first buffer and less than or equal to the value in
	 the second.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  This means that
     the entire volume has been searched and all matches returned.  Otherwise,
     a value of -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

     See the discussion of the EAGAIN, ENOBUFS, and EBUSY error codes above.

COMPATIBILITY
     Not all volumes support searchfs().  You can test whether a volume sup-
     ports searchfs() by using getattrlist(2) to get the volume capabilities
     attribute ATTR_VOL_CAPABILITIES, and then testing the
     VOL_CAP_INT_SEARCHFS flag.

     The searchfs() function has been undocumented for more than two years.
     In that time a number of volume format implementations have been created
     without a proper specification for the behaviour of this routine.	You
     may encounter volume format implementations with slightly different be-
     haviour than what is described here.  Your program is expected to be tol-
     erant of this variant behaviour.

     If you're implementing a volume format that supports searchfs(), you
     should be careful to support the behaviour specified by this document.

     A bug in systems prior to Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X version 10.3) makes
     searching for the ATTR_CMN_BKUPTIME attribute tricky.  The bug causes the
     attribute to consume two items in the search attribute buffers, the first
     in the proper place and the second between ATTR_CMN_FNDRINFO and
     ATTR_CMN_OWNERID.

ERRORS
     searchfs() will fail if:

     [ENOTSUP]		The volume does not support searchfs().

     [ENOTDIR]		A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]	A component of a path name exceeded NAME_MAX charac-
			ters, or an entire path name exceeded PATH_MAX charac-
			ters.

     [ENOENT]		The file system object does not exist.

     [EACCES]		Search permission is denied for a component of the
			path prefix.

     [ELOOP]		Too many symbolic links were encountered in translat-
			ing the pathname.

     [EFAULT]		One of the pointer parameters points to an invalid
			address.

     [EINVAL]		The options parameter contains an invalid flag or
			sizeofsearchparams1/2 is greater than
			SEARCHFS_MAX_SEARCHPARMS (see attr.h).	Additionally,
			filesystems that do not support SRCHFS_SKIPLINKS may
			return EINVAL if this search option is requested.

     [EAGAIN]		The search terminated with partial results, either
			because numMatches has hit the limit specified by
			maxmatches or because the timeout expired.  Process
			the matches returned so far and then call searchfs()
			again to look for more.

     [ENOBUFS]		The returned attributes buffer is too small for the
			first match.  You should allocate a larger returned
			attributes buffer and try again.  numMatches will be
			zero in this case.

     [EBUSY]		The search could not be resumed because the volume has
			changed.

     [EIO]		An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to
			the file system.
