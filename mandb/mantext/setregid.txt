SETREGID(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		   SETREGID(2)

NAME
     setregid -- set real and effective group ID

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     int
     setregid(gid_t rgid, gid_t egid);

DESCRIPTION
     The real and effective group ID's of the current process are set to the
     arguments.  Unprivileged users may change the real group ID to the effec-
     tive group ID and vice-versa; only the super-user may make other changes.

     Supplying a value of -1 for either the real or effective group ID forces
     the system to substitute the current ID in place of the -1 parameter.

     The setregid() function was intended to allow swapping the real and
     effective group IDs in set-group-ID programs to temporarily relinquish
     the set-group-ID value.  This function did not work correctly; its pur-
     pose is now better served by the use of the setegid() function (see
     setuid(2)).

     When setting the real and effective group IDs to the same value, the
     standard setgid() function is preferred.

RETURN VALUES
     The setregid() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the
     value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the
     error.

ERRORS
     [EPERM]		The current process is not the super-user and a change
			other than changing the effective group-id to the real
			group-id was specified.

     The setregid() system call appeared in 4.2BSD.
